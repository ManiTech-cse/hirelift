### Contextual User Profile Integration
All responses now intelligently use the user's profile data when available:

```typescript
// Example: Relocation advice
${userProfile.targetCompanies.length > 0 ? 
  `${userProfile.targetCompanies[0]} typically has offices in multiple locations - worth asking about relocation or remote options!` 
  : ''}

// Example: Skills development
${userProfile.skills.length > 0 ? 
  `With skills in ${userProfile.skills.join(', ')}, you could freelance or build SaaS products!` 
  : ''}

// Example: Cover letter
${userProfile.targetCompanies.length > 0 ? 
  `For ${userProfile.targetCompanies[0]}, research their mission and recent projects to personalize your letter!` 
  : ''}
```

### Smart Keyword Detection
Multiple keyword variations for natural conversation:

```typescript
// Relocation
if (lowerQ.includes('relocat') || lowerQ.includes('move to') || lowerQ.includes('willing to move'))

// Freelancing
if (lowerQ.includes('freelanc') || lowerQ.includes('side project') || lowerQ.includes('side hustle') ||

if (lowerQ.includes('how') || lowerQ.includes('what')) {
  return "I can provide detailed guidance on this. Could you be more specific?";
}

if (lowerQ.includes('when') || lowerQ.includes('timeline')) {
  return "Timelines vary, but typically: Resume (1-2 weeks), Applications (ongoing), Job offer (1-3 months total).";
}

if (lowerQ.includes('best') || lowerQ.includes('top')) {
