## 📊 MATH VERIFICATION

### Day of Year Formula

```javascript
const today = new Date('2025-12-24');
const startOfYear = new Date(2025, 0, 0); // Jan 0 = Dec 31, 2024
const diffTime = today - startOfYear;
const diffDays = Math.floor(diffTime / 86400000); // 86400000ms = 1 day

console.log(diffDays); // 358
```

### Role Index Formula

```javascript
const dayOfYear = 358;
const numRoles = 4;
const roleIndex = dayOfYear % numRoles;

console.log(roleIndex); // 358 % 4 = 2 (3rd role, 0-indexed)
```

### Job ID Formula

```javascript
const company = 'Google';
const date = '2025-12-24';
const index = 0;
const jobId = `${company.toLowerCase()}-${date}-${index}`;

console.log(jobId); // "google-2025-12-24-0"
```
